Today I created my github account and codehs account, I also learned the introduction to coding by watching videos and using Tracy the turtle. I also created a slinky using code and made adjacent circles using code. I learned how to pick up and put down the pen along with how to go backwards and creating a catterpillar using the commands.

# August 31st, 2023

I made a diamond using the turn right and left commands. I also made use of everything learned so far to effieciently break up tracy's world into 4 seperate boxes. I also learned the degrees to make diagonal lines in the boxes. I learned how to make squares using loops, and making mini squares using loop "for i in range"

# September 1st, 2023

I used mostlty loops to efficiently make tracy complete a full square in her grid filled with boxes. I learned how to use angles, I then used the new ways to make angles alone with the loops and the setposition command to make asterisks all around the grid. I made 2 rows of 4 of circles only using loops and the set positions command. I created a pentagon strictly using a loop along with an X. I created a pyramid of circles that all touch using loops and position command.  

# September 5th, 2023

I learned how to use hashtags and quotation marks to create comments to either help me remember what I was doing along with help on lookers at the code understand what is going on if they don't know or is new to coding. I also learned how to correctly name along with give my functions a title using underscores and lowercase letters. I learned how to use the title to create functions that'll make my coding less cluttered and more efficient. Using everything i've learned so far I made a stack of shapes switching between squares and circles to make the tower using the functions and loops while taking up minimal room.

# September 6th

Today I mostly learned how to use the newly introduced color and fill color feature to make tracy use different colors along with how to make her utilize different pen sizes for coding as well as to draw pictures using shapes. I also redid the beaded project to make it colorful for Tracy's birthday. For the most part today was mostly a quality of life day for coding.

# September 7th

Today I made a bunch of different shapes using the advanced cirlce code along with function the end and begin fill, I also changed the background color in this project making it look like the example it told us to follow. Most of class today I was figuring out how to add a "glare" on the bubblewrap project

# September 8th

Today I spent most of class making a sidewalk purely out of squares. The trick was I could only use 16 lines of code it was a difficult challenge for sure but it was pretty fun. I realized not all shapes need the adv circle code but you can go back to the old ways of drawing shapes if youneed to. The hard part that I'll have to learn is the balance between the two.

# September 11th

Today I learned how to use variables to easily increase add or decrease something using math operations. At first I was confused on the point of this and wasn't it just another version of functions but realized the potential it help and the importance of it. I ws stuck a while trying to figure out how to make shapes successfully get bigger while using the shapes but I finally figured it out bu using the radius along with math back to cack to increase then decrease for the shape then increase again.

# September 12th

Today I used newly learned int and input code to reuse the previous nullseye code but change it to ask questions on what color it should be and then make Tracy respond with the color typed into the answer part. It was relatively easy I had to make some slight changes to fix it from the previous to the new code but it wasn't that bad. I made four corners using loops and the input with using user interaction, it was difficult then I remembered I did it before and just copied and pasted then edited with the newer things I've learned.

# September 13th

Today I learned about paramaters and how they can edit your code without having to make more lines. Using this newly learned information I made a catepillar that changed colors every circle without having to create seperate code thus saving time and space it also utilized talking to the audience and they decide the code. I made a circle inside a square using parameters that allows it to be even no matter what radius was put in, this took most of class I got stuck and had to consult the internet but then figured out the rest.

# September 14th

Today I created a snowman that's circles were based off the user input but I made it so that no matter what size it would be it would still be even using parameters and creating them so that they bounce of off each other. I learned hown to utilize the i in a for i in rage code allowing me to be able to create different things by using the i itself as a variable to create different shapes and more later on.

# September 15th

Today I learned how to further utilize the variables in the for i in range functions to increase decrease and set a type of parameter to stop a shape from going bigger than the number and increase in a radius a certain amount. I also used the newly learned variable to make wifi bars increase in radius each time.

# September 18th

Today I learned how to use if staements to allow tracy to make decisions herself along with the help of the user. Like on every odd number switch the color to red and on every even switch it to black. It was very hard to figure out how to use these but I finally figured it out to create a smiley face that is only created if the user is happy.
