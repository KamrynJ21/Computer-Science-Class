Today I created my github account and codehs account, I also learned the introduction to coding by watching videos and using Tracy the turtle. I also created a slinky using code and made adjacent circles using code. I learned how to pick up and put down the pen along with how to go backwards and creating a catterpillar using the commands.

I made a diamond using the turn right and left commands. I also made use of everything learned so far to effieciently break up tracy's world into 4 seperate boxes. I also learned the degrees to make diagonal lines in the boxes. I learned how to make squares using loops, and making mini squares using loop "for i in range"

# September 1st, 2023

I used mostlty loops to efficiently make tracy complete a full square in her grid filled with boxes. I learned how to use angles, I then used the new ways to make angles alone with the loops and the setposition command to make asterisks all around the grid. I made 2 rows of 4 of circles only using loops and the set positions command. I created a pentagon strictly using a loop along with an X. I created a pyramid of circles that all touch using loops and position command.

I learned how to use hashtags and quotation marks to create comments to either help me remember what I was doing along with help on lookers at the code understand what is going on if they don't know or is new to coding. I also learned how to correctly name along with give my functions a title using underscores and lowercase letters. I learned how to use the title to create functions that'll make my coding less cluttered and more efficient. Using everything i've learned so far I made a stack of shapes switching between squares and circles to make the tower using the functions and loops while taking up minimal room.

# September 6th

Today I mostly learned how to use the newly introduced color and fill color feature to make tracy use different colors along with how to make her utilize different pen sizes for coding as well as to draw pictures using shapes. I also redid the beaded project to make it colorful for Tracy's birthday. For the most part today was mostly a quality of life day for coding.

# September 7th

Today I made a bunch of different shapes using the advanced cirlce code along with function the end and begin fill, I also changed the background color in this project making it look like the example it told us to follow. Most of class today I was figuring out how to add a "glare" on the bubblewrap project
