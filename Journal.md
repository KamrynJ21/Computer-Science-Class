Today I created my github account and codehs account, I also learned the introduction to coding by watching videos and using Tracy the turtle. I also created a slinky using code and made adjacent circles using code. I learned how to pick up and put down the pen along with how to go backwards and creating a catterpillar using the commands.

I made a diamond using the turn right and left commands. I also made use of everything learned so far to effieciently break up tracy's world into 4 seperate boxes. I also learned the degrees to make diagonal lines in the boxes. I learned how to make squares using loops, and making mini squares using loop "for i in range"

I used mostlty loops to efficiently make tracy complete a full square in her grid filled with boxes. I learned how to use angles, I then used the new ways to make angles alone with the loops and the setposition command to make asterisks all around the grid. I made 2 rows of 4 of circles only using loops and the set positions command. I created a pentagon strictly using a loop along with an X. I created a pyramid of circles that all touch using loops and position command.
